# EEGNet-MotorImagery-Classification
Uses EEGNet architecture to classify motor imagery tasks into left hand or right hand using the BCI Competition IV 2a Dataset. Also includes a file which directs the user to a ui where they will do a motor imagery task, and the network will predict what had occurred while having no knowledge of the cue, only of the EEG. This requires a 16 Channel EEG machine from OpenBCI, and the OpenBCI GUI application.
